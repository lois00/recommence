## 1398. Customers Who Bought Products A and B but Not C
SQL架构

Table: Customers
```
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| customer_id         | int     |
| customer_name       | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_name is the name of the customer.
```
 

Table: Orders
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| customer_id   | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the id of the customer who bought the product "product_name".
```
 

Write an SQL query to report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who bought products "A", "B" but did not buy the product "C" since we want to recommend them bought this product.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Diana         |
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
| 4           | Jhon          |
+-------------+---------------+

Orders table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| order_id   | customer_id  | product_name  |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| 10         |     1        |     A         |
| 20         |     1        |     B         |
| 30         |     1        |     D         |
| 40         |     1        |     C         |
| 50         |     2        |     A         |
| 60         |     3        |     A         |
| 70         |     3        |     B         |
| 80         |     3        |     D         |
| 90         |     4        |     C         |
+------------+--------------+---------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
+-------------+---------------+
Only the customer_id with id 3 bought the product A and B but not the product C.
```

## Solutions:
思路：

1、先找到所有买了A产品的客户；<br>
2、再找到所有买了B产品的客户；<br>
3、然后找出既买了A产品，又买了B产品的客户，在这些客户中找到那些没有买C产品的客户即可。
```
select a.customer_id,d.customer_name
from (
    select customer_id
    from Orders
    where product_name='A'
) a
inner join(
    select customer_id
    from Orders
    where product_name='B'
) b on a.customer_id=b.customer_id
left join(
    select customer_id
    from Orders
    where product_name='C'
) c on a.customer_id=c.customer_id
left join Customers d on a.customer_id=d.customer_id
where c.customer_id is null
```
