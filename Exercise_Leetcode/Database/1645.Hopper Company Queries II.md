SQL架构

Table: Drivers
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| driver_id   | int     |
| join_date   | date    |
+-------------+---------+
driver_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the driver's ID and the date they joined the Hopper company.
```
 

Table: Rides
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| ride_id      | int     |
| user_id      | int     |
| requested_at | date    |
+--------------+---------+
ride_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a ride, the user's ID that requested it, and the day they requested it.
There may be some ride requests in this table that were not accepted.
```
 

Table: AcceptedRides
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| ride_id       | int     |
| driver_id     | int     |
| ride_distance | int     |
| ride_duration | int     |
+---------------+---------+
ride_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains some information about an accepted ride.
It is guaranteed that each accepted ride exists in the Rides table.
```
 

Write an SQL query to report the percentage of working drivers (working_percentage) for each month of 2020 where:
![formula_1645](../pictures/formula_1645.png)
Note that if the number of available drivers during a month is zero, we consider the working_percentage to be 0.

Return the result table ordered by month in ascending order, where month is the month's number (January is 1, February is 2, etc.). Round working_percentage to the nearest 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example.

 
```

By the end of January --> two active drivers (10, 8) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of February --> three active drivers (10, 8, 5) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.

## Solutions:
### 解法一：自己想的
首先列出2020年每个月末日期month_end，<br>
然后计算截至当前月末的入职司机人数driver_num_byfar，<br>
再计算出2020年每月完成有效车程的司机人数active_rides_month（注意去重），<br>
最后将2020年每月完成有效车程的司机人数active_rides_month，除以截至当前月末的入职司机人数driver_num_byfar，即可得到结果。<br>
需要注意截至当前月末的入职司机人数driver_num_byfar为0的情况。
```

    select '2020-01-31' month_end union all

### 解法二：自己想的-简化版
首先递归列出每个月份编号month_num，<br>
然后计算截至当前月份的入职司机人数driver_num_byfar，<br>
再计算出2020年每月完成有效车程的司机人数active_rides_month（注意去重），<br>
最后将2020年每月完成有效车程的司机人数active_rides_month，除以截至当前月份的入职司机人数driver_num_byfar，即可得到结果。<br>
需要注意截至当前月份的入职司机人数driver_num_byfar为0的情况。
```
with monthlist as (
    select 1 month_num 
	union all
	select monthlist.month_num+1 from monthlist where month_num<12
)
select a.month_num month,
    case when b.driver_num_byfar=0 then 0.00
    else cast(c.active_rides_month*100.0/b.driver_num_byfar as decimal(6,2)) end as working_percentage 
from monthlist a
left join(
    select a.month_num month,
        count(b.driver_id) driver_num_byfar
    from monthlist a
    left join Drivers b on left(convert(varchar,b.join_date,112),6) <= 202000+a.month_num
    group by a.month_num
) b on a.month_num=b.month
left join(
    select a.month_num month,
        count(distinct d.driver_id) active_rides_month
    from monthlist a
    left join Rides c on left(convert(varchar,c.requested_at,112),6) = 202000+a.month_num
    left join AcceptedRides d on c.ride_id=d.ride_id
